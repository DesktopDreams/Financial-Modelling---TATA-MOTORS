# Financial-Modelling---TATA-MOTORS
This is my current progress on learning financial modelling. 

I created a 3-Statement Model that looks clean and professional. 

It uses minimal hard-coded inputs, and has check system in place. 

I also learnt doing budgeting and ratio analysis on excel, as seen in the previews.

For a more detailed view, it can be seen through the file provided.
